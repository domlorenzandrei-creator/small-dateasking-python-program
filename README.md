# small-dateasking-python-program
A small and simple python program that I made to ask someone out.

Date Invitation Script

A small Python terminal program that asks someone out using an interactive conversation.

The script greets the person, asks if they want to go on a date, and changes its response based on the user’s input.

How it works

The program prints a greeting.

It asks if the person wants to go on a date.

If the answer is yes, it asks about a suggested place and date.

If the answer is no, it prints a sad response.

If the input is not y or n, it asks the user to enter a valid answer.

Example flow
Hello, xyrene
I miss you and I want to go on a date with you
Do you want to? (y/n): y
Yehey! I'm so happy!
Greenbelt at Feb 15? (y/n): y
Cool, lemme sundo you ulit sa inyo :>

Concepts practiced

Defining and calling functions

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Getting user input from the terminal

Basic program flow and nesting conditions

Requirements

Python 3

How to run
python project.py

Possible improvements

Make input case-insensitive (accept Y or N)

Repeat the question until a valid answer is given

Allow changing the name, date, or place dynamically

Separate logic into more functions

Add more dialogue paths
